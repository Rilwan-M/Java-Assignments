once connection is succesfful with server, whenever a message is sent to the server from client it printed additional character also.  
if i sent 'Hi' it got as â™¥hi so 
    --> OutputStreamWriter didnt work properly,
    --> So PrintWriter i used for write message for ouput and for taking input from client I used "Scanner"
